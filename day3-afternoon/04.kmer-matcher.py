"""
Extend k-mer counter to k-mer matcher
Implement a script that finds matching k-mers between a single 
query sequence and a database of targets. The matcher should take three arguments:
kmer_matcher.py <target.fa> <query.fa> <k>
Where target.fa is the database, potentially multiple sequences, 
query.fa is the sequence to align (assume just one sequnce), and k is the k-mer size 
(an integer).
The script should find k-mer matches and for each write:
target_sequence_name    target_start    query_start k-mer
Run the program for k=11 and submit the first 1000 lines.
